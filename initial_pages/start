= Welcome to the rapidito database =

This is the 0.1 release. For now there is a simple wiki implementation, that borrows lots of the wiki syntax from trac. 

Check out the _syntax to see how to write pages for the rapidito. 

The _README file has instructions to install and develop rapidito.

rapidito is released with the AGPL 3 _license and it's the creation of Aureliano Calvo (http://aurelianito.blogspot.com).
