== Font Styles ==

rapidito supports the following font styles:
{{{
 * '''bold''', '''!''' can be bold too''', and '''! '''
 * ''italic''
 * '''''bold italic'''''
 * __underline__
 * {{{monospace}}} or `monospace`
 * ~~strike-through~~
 * ^superscript^ 
 * ,,subscript,,
}}}

Display:
 * '''bold''', '''!''' can be bold too''', and '''! '''
 * ''italic''
 * '''''bold italic'''''
 * __underline__
 * {{{monospace}}} or `monospace`
 * ~~strike-through~~
 * ^superscript^ 
 * ,,subscript,,

Notes:
 * `{{{...}}}` and {{{`...`}}} commands not only select a monospace font, but also treat their content as verbatim text, meaning that no further wiki processing is done on this text.
 * {{{ ! }}} tells wiki parser to not take the following characters as wiki format, so pay attention to put a space after !, e.g. when ending bold.

== Paragraphs ==

A new text paragraph is created whenever two blocks of text are separated by one or more empty lines.

== Headings ==

You can create heading by starting a line with one up to five ''equal'' characters ("=")
followed by a single space and the headline text. The line should end with a space 
followed by the same number of ''='' characters.
Example:
{{{
= Heading =
== Subheading ==
=== About ''this'' ===
}}}

Display:

= Heading =
== Subheading ==
=== About ''this'' ===

== Lists ==

The wiki supports both ordered/numbered and unordered lists.

Example:
{{{
 * Item 1
   * Item 1.1
      * Item 1.1.1   
      * Item 1.1.2
      * Item 1.1.3
   * Item 1.2
 * Item 2

 1. Item 1
   a. Item 1.a
   a. Item 1.b
      i. Item 1.b.i
      i. Item 1.b.ii
 1. Item 2
And numbered lists can also be given an explicit number:
 3. Item 3
}}}

Display:
 * Item 1
   * Item 1.1
      * Item 1.1.1
      * Item 1.1.2
      * Item 1.1.3
   * Item 1.2
 * Item 2

 1. Item 1
   a. Item 1.a
   a. Item 1.b
      i. Item 1.b.i
      i. Item 1.b.ii
 1. Item 2
And numbered lists can also be given an explicit number:
 3. Item 3

Note that there must be one or more spaces preceding the list item markers, otherwise the list will be treated as a normal paragraph.

== Definition Lists ==

The wiki also supports definition lists.

Example:
{{{
llama:: some kind of mammal, with hair
ppython:: some kind of reptile, without hair (can you spot the typo?)
}}}

Display:

llama:: some kind of mammal, with hair
ppython:: some kind of reptile, without hair (can you spot the typo?)

== Preformatted Text ==

Block containing preformatted text are suitable for source code snippets, notes and examples. Use three ''curly braces'' wrapped around the text to define a block quote. The curly braces need to be on a separate line.
  
Example:
{{{
 {{{
  def HelloWorld():
      print "Hello World"
 }}}
}}}

Display:
{{{
 def HelloWorld():
     print "Hello World"
}}}

== rapidito links ==

Unlike trac, rapidito generates links to other pages by linking words together. For instance this_is_a_link, an it is written as {{{this_is_a_link}}} in the page source. 

Single word links can be generated by prepending a simple _ in front of the page name. For instance to link to the _start page write {{{_start}}} in the page source.

Links are case insensitive. _Start and _start point to the same page. Links also support accentuation in several languages. For instance, this is a legal link: luz_cámara_acción.

Use {{{!}}} to escape links.
